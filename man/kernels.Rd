\title{Kernels used in summarizing features}
\usage{
kernel_gaussian(d, r = 100, FUN = sum)

kernel_parabola(d, r = 100, FUN = sum)

kernel_uniform(d, r = 100, FUN = sum)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{vector of distances}

\item{r}{radius of interest}

\item{FUN}{reduce function}
}
\value{
numeric, function (usually sum) of kernel-weighted distances
}
\description{
Kernels convert distance vectors to single numbers, with a certain weight
for certain distances. In general, at 0 distance, these return a value of 1,
and the value decreases as the distance increases, reaching 0 at the limit
of the support.

\details{
Gaussian kernel is a truncated gaussian, where r = 4*sigma
(i.e., std. dev = r/4).The density which is truncated away is
1 - erf(2 sqrt(2)), which is approximately 0.0000633.
Parabola kernel is parabolic, decreasing with distance within
radius r, and returns 0 elsewhere. It is a scaled Epanechnikov kernel.
Uniform kernel returns 1 within radius r, 0 elsewhere.
